Does yourÂ institution have an accessibility policy for digital content acquisition? Other (please specify)

LIbrary administration requires that we append a license admendment to all e-resource licenses that ensure accessibility. Language in the amendment is taken from ARL's model license from the ARL Accessibility Toolkit. 
We have standard accessibility language that we try to include in every e-resource license agreement.
