internally tracked

Review by campus-wide committee
By mandate from library dean

Violations are corrected when identified by Accessibility Group members or from outside the organization, but there is not a regular process or audit looking for violations to the policy.
Self-enforced
Automated checks from SiteImprove and periodic reviews from organizational and institutional staff
