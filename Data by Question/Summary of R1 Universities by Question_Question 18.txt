Who is responsible for updating your accessibility policy for content acquisition, and how often is it audited/updated?

Only recently developed, so can't say
Me - annually
unknown, it's a new policy
Purdue Executive Policy Review Group - unsure of audit/update timeline
see answer to first question for this section
With no formal policy, no specific person is responsible for updating the policy
Policy is at the university level. Licensing language/best practices within library are managed by a team and reviewed regularly.
