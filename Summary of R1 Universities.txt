LIbrary administration requires that we append a license admendment to all e-resource licenses that ensure accessibility. Language in the amendment is taken from ARL's model license from the ARL Accessibility Toolkit. 
We have standard accessibility language that we try to include in every e-resource license agreement.

With no formal policy, no specific person is responsible for updating the policy
Policy is at the university level. Licensing language/best practices within library are managed by a team and reviewed regularly.

If your institution provides financial support for the creation of Open Access (OA) content, are you held to the same accessibility mandates as for licensed content? Other (please specify)

Don't know
Unclear - this situation hasn't come up yet. 
we do provide financial support for creation of OA materials (SCOAP3 for example), but I'm unsure of the correct answer to this question
unknown
If there is a license agreement for the OA content, then we request that our preferred accessibility clause be included.



-------------------------------------
How is your accessibility policy for content acquisition enforced?

Primarily through institutional license agreements for licensed content
it's tracked internally
unknown
It's really not - campus officials don't know when we're subscribing to new content unless it's over a certain amount of money, then procurement has to get involved and negotiate contracts. 
through licensing provisions
It depends on the situation. We use a software program to scan webpages for problems and IT folks are responsible for correcting those problem.

At Michigan Publishing, the policy is driven by an Accessibility Group that includes members across all units of Michigan Publishing
Central accessibility office (new - no update schedule yet)
Central Technology Services unit at the university; updated annually. Local policies at our library flow from and sometimes expand upon that guidance.

unknown
Self-enforced
Our policy for hosted software is much more lax than the policy for software developed in-house. We don't have procurement requirements that require a certain level of accessibility compliance. Individuals at our institution/library can talk with vendors about making products accessible, but our policy does not require it.
All systems must go through internal review before public launch
