## What files are important?
The combined summary data from all R1 institutions that responded in the Accessibility 
survey given by Lyrasis can be found in the file 'Summary of R1 Universities.txt'. 

## What are the "Data by Institution" and "Data by Question" folders?
These two folders contain text files that represented the same extracted R1 data from the 
Accessibility survey. In "Data by Institution", each R1 institution has a separate file, 
detailing all of their answers to the questions. Blank answers were not included. 

In "Data by Question", the R1 data has been extracted again, and this time, each question 
has a separate text file. Within each text file are all responses from R1 institutions for 
that question. 

## Where is the code?
All code written to extract this data can be found in the three .py files that all begin 
with 'accessibility_r1_...'.
